### When you're using other's local project written in dart with package.

Used Dart Package installed with pub must be reclaimed.

1. If pub is not installed
   1. Terminal - flutter pub get

### how to add packages

### Stateful widgets.

statsless widgets are immutable. so we can't change.

#### Needs

* State class
  * persists lifetime of the widget.
* StatefulWidget class
  * makes instance of State class
  * immutable
  * can be thrown away

**stful for codesnippet**



### ListView's builder factory constructor

which allows me to build a list view **lazily**



## main()'s method must be wrapped by runApp();

always the starting point is 

```dart
void main() => runApp
```

don't forget.



## Basic Widgets

### Text

just some kind of text box.

### Row, Column

privides flexible layout which based web's flexbox layout model.

### Stack

like web's absolute positioning layout model.

> use Positioned Widget to set relatively to the top, right, left , bottom

### Container

let us to create a rectanglar visual element. can be decorated with  BoxDecoration Widget. Which allows us adjust background, border, shadow.

As this widget offer us **Rectangular** visual element, this can have margin, padding, and so on



## Using Material Components

### Scaffold

#### Contains

* appBar
* body
* and..so on. quite lot

Anyway it is not just only appbar. it's more lika panel which have appBar

<img src="referenceImage/Flutter/image-20210203101802694.png" alt="image-20210203101802694" style="zoom:%;" />

### AppBar

![image-20210203101831657](referenceImage/Flutter/image-20210203101831657.png)

bottom: generally used for TabBar. which is not goal of mine so move on.

### DefaultTabController

which needs **3** widgets

* DefaultTabController
* TabBar
  locates AppBar's bottom
* TabBarView
  locates DefaultTabController's body



### Stateless Widget and Stateful Widget.

#### Stateless Widget

immutable. so once setted it can't be change.

#### Stateful widget

can have mutable variables. and 



### Main, Cross Axis Alignment

`mainAxisAlignment` and `crossAxisAlignment` is the property of Column, Row Elements.

main is main direction and cross is crossed direction



## How this tutorial made spaces.

### padding in Container Widget

```dart
 padding: const EdgeInsets.only(botton: 8),
```



## Animate a widget across screens

### Hero

which privides same image transition.

Each Screen widget need to have `Hero Widget with same tag`

and then just `Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder:(_){return DetailScreen();}))`



## Navigate to a new screen and back

* Navigator.push
* Navigator.pop



## Pass arguments

In this Example it was confusing because two suggestion was suggested.

first is using `onGenerateRoute` event inside of MaterialApp.



Both method needs same call method.

```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(
                  context,
                  targetScreen.routeName,
                  arguments: argumentDataClass(
                    'arg1',
                    'arg2',
                  ),
                );
```



#### get Arguments with BuildContext

* using MaterialApp's routes
  * when target route comes then returns assigned widget.

```dart
/// inside of MaterialApp
routes: {
          ExtractArgumentsScreen.routeName: (context) =>
              ExtractArgumentsScreen(),
        });
```



#### get Arguments with onGenerateRoute event

* using MaterialApp's onGenerateRoute
  * When Route generates, **onGenerateRoute** event calls. 
    So this event can get route name and using that parameter 
    returns appropriate widget.
  * We can handle routes didn't made by

```dart
assert(false, 'Need to implement ${settings.name}');
```

## How can we use this...

Actually i don't know hoe to use this mehods.

but if i can..

i can make screen like this

  if session available

Splash - login page - main page

â€‹	     - main page



## Return Data From screen

using async await.

we can get return value from other Screen

and `Navigator.pop` have a result parameter to toss result value.

so..

>  Navigator.pop<T>(context, <T>value)

to return value.

### Scaffold's SnackBar Widget(?)

Scaffold have a snackBar. Which is 



## Drawer

> Is a sideBar.

Think like... Yugioh's `draw!`

then side bar slides to screen

else... just press hamburger button.
